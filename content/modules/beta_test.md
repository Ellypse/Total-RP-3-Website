*/

We provide beta test versions of Storyline for users who are willing to live on the bleeding edge of innovation and want to test the latest features and bug fixes we are implementing into Storyline. **Please be aware that beta versions may be unstable and may contain critical bugs**, even if we try our best and test everything before releasing a beta version. **We encourage you to make a backup of your WTF folder (the folder containing your add-ons settings) before trying beta versions.**

**No beta version available for now. We should release beta versions for update 1.3 of Storyline soon.**

**If you no longer want to beta test Storyline and would like to go back using a previous stable release, we strongly encourage you to delete your settings by deleting your `Storyline.lua` file contained in the folder `World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME/SavedVariables/`**
