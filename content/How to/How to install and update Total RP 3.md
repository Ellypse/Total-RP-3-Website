Total RP 3 is available for download on [Curse][curse trp3]. There are two ways to install and update Total RP 3. The first and easy one is to use the [Curse Client](#curse), a desktop application that will manage your add-ons folder for you. Unfortunately, Curse has drop the support for their Client for Mac OS X. It still works (it crashes sometimes, but it does the job), but if you don't want to use the Curse Client you can [install and update your add-ons manually](#manually)

## <a name="curse"></a> Using Curse Client

[Curse] is one of the main repository of add-ons. They offer a free desktop app they call the Curse Client that you can download on [this page][client]. 

Using the Curse Client requires a free Curse account (you can register [here][curse register]).

Once authenticated, the Client will scan for existing add-ons on your installation. If it founds updates, they will be indicated by an update button. All you have to do is click this button to update the add-on.

Once the Curse Client is installed, you can use it to install new add-ons for you, either by browsing the built in repository of add-ons.

Or by clicking the "Install via Curse Client" button while browsing on Curse website ([click here to install Total RP 3 using Curse Client][client trp3]).

## <a name="manually"></a> Manually

If you don't want to use the Curse Client, you can manually download a .zip archive of the latest version of Total RP 3 by clicking on the "Download Now" on [Total RP 3 Curse page][curse trp3].

![Download Total RP 3 using the download button][trp3_download_button]

Once the download is finished, you have to extract the .zip archive. You should get a folder named totalRP3 containing several files and folder.

![Total RP 3 folder][trp3_folder]

If the folder is not named `totalRP3` you will have to rename it, otherwise World of Warcraft will not be able to find it.

Now move this folder into your `World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/` folder. If you had a previous version of Total RP 3 installed, you will have to replace the old one.

![If you are asked to replace the existing folder, accept][trp3_move_folder]

When launching World of Warcraft, check that Total RP 3 is in the list of add-ons found by World of Warcraft by clicking on the add-ons button in the lower left corner.

You may have to check the option "Load Out of Date Addons" if a patch for World of Warcraft was recently released and Total RP 3 hasn't been updated yet.
