Title: Total RP 3 and incompatibilities the Legion expansion
*/

> _This article was our April fools' day joke for April 1st 2016. As far as we know, there is no issue with Demon Hunters and Total RP 3.

Hello folks. We have had access to Legion's alpha for a couple of weeks thanks to our friends at [WoWInterface][Fishing Buddy] and now that we had some times fiddling with the changes in the game API in Legion we wanted to share some thoughts with you today.

> **TL;DR:**
> Total RP 3 will **not** be compatible with **Demon Hunters** in Legion due to **limitations** in the API **placed by Blizzard**. We strongly advise people who will want to use Total RP 3 in Legion to **not roll a Demon Hunter**.

## What is the issue?

We immediately started working on making Total RP 3 compatible with Legion so we can release an update on day one. Once the small bits have been fixed, we created Demon Hunter characters to test Total RP 3 with them. Telkostrasz and I were able to see each others profile and everything was working great.

Until we left Mardum. Once out of the Demon Hunters starting area we tried with several combination of races, classes and factions in both [Orgrimmar][Old Crafty] and [Ironforge][Old Ironjaw] but **we were not able to see others profiles**. It seemed we can see other Demon Hunters profiles (we were actually able to see them **cross faction** this time! [Bloodelves][Drathen] Demon Hunters can see [Nightelves][Talaelar] Demon Hunters profiles!).

If this issue is still here for the release of the expansion, **if you choose to play a Demon Hunters you will only be able to roleplay between Demon Hunters**.

## The explanation

We did some digging around the code and a lot of testing and it seems that **Blizzard has placed a limitation on Demon Hunters for Legion**. The **protocol** used for exchanging data (the Mary Sue Protocol, the xtensionxtooltip2 channel and the direct method of sending data via SendAddonMessage()) **is different** for Demon Hunters.

A variable introduced inside Blizzard's code named `DEMONIC_INFLUENCE` seems to act as **a modifier for the messages exchanged**, even between add-ons. It's basically some kind of complex encryption, **but we don't have the key**.

We have submitted [a ticket][Undelivered Love Letter] to Blizzard to inform them of the issue and have not received a response yet, but since it is clearly something they did by design they might just dismiss our ticket.
