/*
Title: Storyline 1.0
*/

## Standalone

- As we believe this add-on can reach more people than just the role-playing community, we made Storyline a standalone add-on, Total RP 3 is no longer required.

**WARNING: Storyline folder's name changed when we made it standalone. If you had previous beta version, you will have to manually remove the old totalRP3_Storyline add-on folder.**

## Rewards

- You can now choose your rewards within Storyline. We implemented a nice UI that recaps the rewards you will receive. You expect the same behavior as the default quest frame (item comparison, CTRL + Click to preview item in the dressing room, SHIFT + Click to insert a link).

## Options

We added an option button in the bottom left corner to let you access key settings:

- Text animation timing: a slider let you choose the speed of the animation (or to have no animation at all)
- Auto equip reward (experimental): you can choose to automatically equip a reward if its iLvl is higher than what you currently have (this is experimental and disabled by default).

## UI

We've made some nice enhancements to the overall UI.

- Popup: We now use custom popups instead of dropdown menus for dialog choices.

- The quest objectives now use the custom popups and are displayed in a nicer way, with indication if the objectives are completed or not.

- Animation timing: We timed all combination of playable races and sexes animations. Animations should now transition from one another smoothly.
- Model scaling: We've started working on model scaling. This is a huge task and we've barely scratch the surface of it. Some specific models will be correctly scaled (male draenei and male human).

## Bugs fixes

- We hammered a nasty little bug where quest were available from the default quest frame but not listed in Storyline
- Fixed an issue when several new line characters were following each others (Blizzard… ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)
