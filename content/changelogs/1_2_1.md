## Dice rolls

The dice rolls from TRP2 are back! Use the command "/trp3 roll" to roll a 1d100 dice. You can also roll several dices at once by indicating the count and type of dices. Any roll you make is shared with your party/raid/target if they have TRP3 1.2.1.

Examples:
/trp3 roll 1d6
/trp3 roll 2d20 1d12
