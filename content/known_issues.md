## Known issues for version 1.0.3

Nothing. Let's hope it stays that way :D

## Compatibility issues

### With ElvUI

ElvUI customizes the world map to add coordinates and to have a smaller world map. This features are messing with Total RP 3’s customization of the world map: the button to initiate a player location scan. If you are having issue clicking on the button to initiate a player scan, please disable the map coordinates and scaling features inside ElvUI settings. (Thanks to Abracapocus for reporting this issue and finding the solution ❤️) 

### With other chat add-ons
